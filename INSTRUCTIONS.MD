# Circular Doubly Linked List — Autograding Hints & Tips

> **Note to the Brave and Creative students:**  
> If you’ve taken one look at the classic method names like `insert_at_end` and thought,  
> *“Yawn… Too boring! I’ll jazz it up and rename everything to something cooler,”*  
> this is your friendly warning: the autograder is clever, but not psychic.  
> It tries to guess your method names, but keep it reasonably close — or the tests might give you a thumbs down.  
> So, if you want to put your creativity to work, that’s awesome — just make sure the autograder can still find your magic methods!

## How to Get a Good Score on the Tests — Friendly Hints

### 1. Implement Core Methods Clearly 
The tests check these essential operations:  
- **Insert at the end** of the list (common name: `insert_at_end`)  
- **Insert at the beginning** of the list (common name: `insert_at_beginning`)  
- **Remove a node by value** (`remove_by_value`)  
- Display the list **forward** and **backward** (e.g., `show_list_forward`, `show_list_backward`)

If you rename them, try to keep similar words so the tests recognize them.

### 2. Maintain Circularity and Links  
Remember, this is no ordinary linked list — it’s **circular** and **doubly linked**. That means:  
- The node after the last node loops back to the first node  
- The node before the first node loops back to the last node  
- Every node keeps pointers to both the previous and next nodes  

Your insertion and removal logic should keep these relationships intact. If your list stops being circular or the pointers get mixed up, the tests will notice.

### 3. Handle Edge Cases Properly or Gracefully
Be sure to handle tricky situations:  
- What happens when you insert into an **empty list**?  
- What if you remove the **only node** in the list?  
- Removing the **first node** or the **last node** — make sure the list adjusts correctly  
- Removing a node with a value that **doesn’t exist** — your program should handle this gracefully without crashing

### 4. Output Matters  
The tests expect your display functions to print the list values in a readable format:  
- Forward display should list values separated by `" -> "`  
- Backward display should list values separated by `" <- "`  
- When the list is empty, print a clear message like `"The list is empty."`  

Don't overthink the formatting — just keep it simple and consistent.

### 5. Comments and Clean Code Win Hearts  
It’s not just about passing tests — good comments and readable code help you and the graders understand your logic.  
Explain how you maintain the circular links and handle insertions/removals, so if something goes wrong, you can fix it faster.

---

### Summary  
- Stick close to the suggested method names or obvious variants  
- Keep the circular links tight and consistent  
- Handle edge cases gracefully  
- Make your output clear and easy to read  
- Comment your code like you’re explaining to a curious crush who has no idea what coding is  

**PS:** In short, for those hoping the autograder is might detect crafty method names, it will not, at least not now, unless we use an AI Engine for that. Keep your code straightforward and your method names recognizable.
        _`Remember, the end shall justify the mean; In this case, playing by the rules will unlock the treasure`_

Happy coding!
